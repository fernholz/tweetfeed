This is my holding place for some twitter parsing and manipulation tools that I'm working on. The main bit is going to be a Wordpress Plugin and the other is going to be it's own standalone project.

Keep looking here for changes and if you have any input, suggestions, or questions - Please don't hesitate to contact me personally.
